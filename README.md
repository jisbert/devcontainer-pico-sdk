# Dev container for Raspberry Pi Pico SDK

Dev container for Raspberry Pi Pico SDK. The published image can be used to setup the development environment for a project for the Raspberry Pi Pico using the [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) or [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), among others. It can also be used to build the project with GitHub Actions or other supported CI systems.

For more information about dev containers, read [the docs](https://containers.dev/overview).

This project is heavily inspired by the wonderful [Pico SDK setup for Windows](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-windows-installer/).
